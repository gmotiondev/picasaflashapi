Picasa Flash API (PFA) is a simple ActionScript 3.0 library for the Google's Picasaweb Data API. With PFA you can access Picasaweb feeds within the Flash Player or Adobe AIR.

PFA handles the feed loading and parsing, so on the end of the "feed reading process", you have your Picasaweb data ready in a "value objects". Take it please for now as experimental (changes are reguraly commited).

~~Because of security restrictions (see GoogleAccountsAuthentication)~~ Picasa Flash API is read-only and you cannot be authenticated yet to Google Accounts via Flash Player. You can only read public albums, photos, comments, tags, search for community pictures etc. Authentication framework code is in progress.



Any suggestions? Feel free to contact me (michal.gron@gmail.com).
